# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
Course Project for Coursera Data Science course III

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps.

The output of the 5th step is called average_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's page.
